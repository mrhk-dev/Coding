What is kubernetes?
Kubernetes an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications.

Why to use kubernetes?
Docker can be used to create and manage containers, it lacks several features that Kubernetes provides for orchestrating those containers effectively:
    * Container Orchestration: 
        Docker does not have built-in orchestration capabilities like Kubernetes. 
        While Docker Swarm offers some orchestration features, it is less robust than Kubernetes.
    * Scaling and Load Balancing: 
        Kubernetes automatically scales applications based on traffic and load. 
        Docker requires additional tools or manual intervention to achieve similar functionality.
    * Service Discovery: 
       Kubernetes provides built-in service discovery mechanisms that allow containers to communicate with each other seamlessly. 
        Docker lacks this level of integration.
    * Health Monitoring: 
        Kubernetes continuously monitors the health of containers and can automatically restart or replace unhealthy instances. 
        Docker does not have this capability natively.
