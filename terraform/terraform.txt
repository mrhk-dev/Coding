What is Terraform?
    Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) software tool created by HashiCorp. 
    It allows users to define and provision infrastructure resources in a declarative configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).
    terraform makes sure to have the actual state based on desired state

Why terraform?
    terraform is a popular infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that provides several benefits for managing cloud and on-premises resources:

* Multi-Cloud Compatibility
  terraform supports over 100 providers including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Kubernetes, and more.
    This allows managing infrastructure across multiple cloud providers using the same syntax
  
* Infrastructure as Code
    terraform uses a declarative configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) to define infrastructure resources in human-readable files that can be versioned, shared, and reused.

* Automation and Efficiency
    terraform handles the underlying logic when creating resources, eliminating the need for manual effort. 
    It determines resource dependencies and can create or modify non-dependent resources in parallel, ensuring resources are provisioned properly and efficiently.

* Collaboration and Consistency
    terraform configuration files can be committed to version control systems, enabling collaboration and preventing unauthorized changes. 
    Using modules, teams can define and share approved infrastructure patterns for consistency across environments
    
* Tracking and Visibility
    terraform configuration files can be committed to version control systems, enabling collaboration and preventing unauthorized changes. 
    Using modules, teams can define and share approved infrastructure patterns for consistency across environments

* Flexibility and Portability
    terraform's declarative syntax and modular architecture provide flexibility in configuration and deployment. 
    The ability to manage resources across cloud and on-premises environments offers portability

terraform vs OpenTofu:
    terraform and OpenTofu are both infrastructure as code (IaC) tools designed for managing cloud resources, but they have distinct characteristics and licensing models that set them apart. 

How terraform is different from ci/cd pipeline?
    terraform and CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines serve different but complementary roles in the software development and infrastructure management lifecycle.
    Hereâ€™s a detailed comparison highlighting their differences:
        * terraform:
            terraform is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows users to define and provision cloud infrastructure using a declarative configuration language (HCL). 
            Its primary purpose is to automate the creation, modification, and management of infrastructure resources across various cloud providers.
        * CI/CD Pipeline:
            A CI/CD pipeline is a set of automated processes that allow for continuous integration of code changes and continuous deployment of applications. 
            It focuses on automating the software delivery process, including building, testing, and deploying applications to various environments.

What is Infra provisioning?
    The process of creating infrastructure by expressing our infra needs in a declarative way and then executing the template to create infra structure(virtual).
        ex: I want a Linux VM with 2 CPUs and 8gb ram

What is infrastructure?
    Infrastructure refers to the foundational components and resources that are necessary to run applications and services. 
    This includes both low-level resources, such as servers and storage, and high-level components, such as networking configurations and DNS entries. 
    terraform enables users to define, provision, and manage these resources through a declarative configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).

What is Procedural provisioning?
	manually installing.

Infrastructure as code:
    Infrastructure as a code (IAC) is a concept where you express your infrastructure in a declarative way.
	    We need to express
	    What we want to create/manage (Resource)
	    Outputs	

Terraform components:
    Inputs: arguments
    Outputs: attributes
    Providers: where to create
    Resource: what to create

What are terraform provider?

How terraform works:
    terraform can interact with specific providers (AWS, Azure, VMware) to create/manage infrastructure 
    Each Provider will have lots of resources which we can define to create infra.

Executing terraform:
    terraform --help
    terraform init
    terraform apply
    terraform delete

Template:
    In terraform we need to express infrastructure in a declarative fashion and what we create is called as template.
    terraform takes a folder as input considering all .tf files a folder

terraform installation:


terraform Workflow:
    Create a new folder for every infra
    we will be adding .tf files
    initialize terraform
    validate terraform
    format terraform
    apply
    destroy    


terraform commands:
    terraform init:
    terraform validate:
    terraform fmt:
    terraform apply:


Terraform Ways of Working:
	Ensure you know how to manually create resources
	List out all the resources and ensure you have creation order
	For each resource, list all the inputs you are passing
	For each resource you have created manually, find the equivalent terraform resource.

Resource Blocks:
Resources are the most important element in the Terraform language. 
Each resource block describes one or more infrastructure objects, such as virtual networks, compute instances, or higher-level components such as DNS records.

Resource Syntax:
ex:
	resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  		ami           = "ami-a1b2c3d4"
  		instance_type = "t2.micro"
	}

Using terraform Attributes:
ex:
	resource "aws_vpc" "base" {
		cidr_block = var.vpc_config.cidr_block
  		tags       = var.vpc_config.tags
	}

	resource "aws_subnet" "subnets" {
  		count             = length(var.subnets_config)
  		availability_zone = var.subnets_config[count.index].availability_zone
  		vpc_id            = aws_vpc.base.id
  		cidr_block        = var.subnets_config[count.index].cidr_block
  		tags              = var.subnets_config[count.index].tags
	}

from the above example the resource aws_subnet ubnet is dependent on aws_vpc
we defined its dependency in vpc_id
here the awc_vpc is type and base is resource name and id is the variable

We can also add the depends_on variable as well.
ex: 
	resource "aws_vpc" "base" {
		cidr_block = var.vpc_config.cidr_block
		tags       = var.vpc_config.tags
	}

	resource "aws_subnet" "subnets" {
		count             = length(var.subnets_config)
		availability_zone = var.subnets_config[count.index].availability_zone
		vpc_id            = aws_vpc.base.id
		cidr_block        = var.subnets_config[count.index].cidr_block
		tags              = var.subnets_config[count.index].tags
		depends_on = [
			aws_vpc.base
		]
	}

So in the above example vpc_id of vpc is the attribute

In Azure we first create the resource then network then subnet.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now we can create the variable template 
We generally try to store all the variables in "variable.tf" or "inputs.tf"
variable syntax:
variable "<variable_name>" {
    type =  string | number | bool | map | object | list
    description = 
    default = 
}


If we do not provide the default variable, it will then ask for the value.

So we try to make the template generic.
for this we use count for creating multiple subnets.

variable.tf
variable "aws_vpc_resource name"{
	type = string
	default = "aws_vpc"
}
main.tf
ex: resource "aws_vpc_subnet" "subnet"{
	count = 4
	address_prefex = var.subnet[count.index] #this is just for example
}


use of object in variable
ex:
	variable "vpcinfo"{
		type = object({
			cidr_block = string
			tag = map(string)
		})
		default = {
			cidr_block = ""
			tag = {
				// provide required tags of choice
			}
		}
	}


Now how to pass these all the variable?
option 1: terraform apply -var varname = "variable valiues" etc
option 2: terraform apply -var-file = 'dev.tfvars'

in option 2 we pass all the values of the variables in a file called dev.tfvar, we can change the file name accordingly

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terraform Functions:

We can use terraform console to view the functions
There are various built-in functions.

Now we can replace the count value with length(var.varname)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aws Ntier Architecture:



----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terraform conditions:

Terraform local:
to use the local conditions multiple time we can create a local file
and pass the data inside the local block
ex:
	locals{
		do_we_have_to_create = lenght(var.varname) > 0 ? 1 : 0
	}

refer with local.do_we...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terraform state management:

Terraform has plan, which compares the difference in states.
The state file will have all the information about the current resource state.
You should never be editing this state file and shouldn't exit in the local system as well.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terraform resource importing:

If the resource was created manually, and now if we want to manage them in terraform how do we do that.
First create the provider file with provider.tf
then in main.tf write the following code:

`terraform import aws_vpc.base "vpc_id"`
the base is name that we are providing for managing in terraform.
The vpc_id is provided from the resource or the vpc created manually.

then if it asks to create resource block with "aws_vpc" "base", then create it
we can then reenter the above command of `terraform import aws_vpc.base "vpc_id"`
then execute "terraform plan" this is to let the terraform know that these resources shouldn't be created.

We can then execute the terraform state aws_vpc.base to show the current state of the resource.
We can then validate the file with "terraform validate"
Then execute "terraform plan", this should not show that it is going to create the resource.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terraform Workspace:

Workspaces are isolated environments within a single Terraform configuration that allow you to manage multiple instances of the same infrastructure. Each workspace has its own state file, enabling separate management of resources.
We know that two developers can not write into the file due to lock mechanism for preventing crashes.
But we want dev and qa to execute the file parallelly.
This can be done by creating two workspaces, meaning by creating the storage on the cloud and providing the storage path.
As the most important file in terraform is state file, this keeps the record of the environment and all.
Refer here for more info: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state/workspaces

You can view the current workspaces with "Terraform workspace list"
But this will only work if the backend is selected.

We can select the workspace with "Terraform workspace select workspace_name"

=========================================================================================
How Organisations use terraform:

Terraform best practices:
choose google terraform starnd module structure.

organisation mostly uses terraform modules.

Then after creating the ec3 instance if we want to install any software's using scripts while creating ec2 we use null_resouce

The null_resouce can be used to execute multiple scripts and also get them changed after ec2 is created.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terrascan:

This is used to scan for vunerabilities in the terraform 

we only need to execute one command "terascan scan"





===================================================================================================

null_block for running bash commands:
This is to make changes to the software's if are provided at the time of infra building.
